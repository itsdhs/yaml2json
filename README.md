Yaml2Json
===

I hate JSON. I love YAML. Unfortunately many of the codebases I work on use JSON as the primary data format

So I wrote a handy Python script to convert between the two

Additionaly, there's a Sublime Text plugin that can easily bind two commands ('yaml_to_json' and 'json_to_yaml') to keystrokes
